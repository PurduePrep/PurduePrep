1Problem 1 [20 points]
1. The Rosetta stone was a monumental discovery for linguistics and archaeology. Ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphics had been undecipherable until archaeologists excavated a stone tablet
at Rosetta which contained the same message written in both Ancient Egyptian and legible
Greek scripts. Using this tablet, historians could decipher the long lost Egyptian language
leading to massive strides in Egyptology.
Now imagine yourself in the shoes of an Egyptologist who has stumbled upon a similar stone
inscription as shown below:
You are currently unfamiliar with Ancient Egyptian but thanks to the Rosetta stone, you
now know that the Egyptian alphabet shares a similar frequency distribution as the English
alphabet. These frequency distributions are given in Figure 1 on the next page. Using these
distributions, can you ﬁll in the missing letters on the inscription? [ 3 points ]
2. There is now a new piece of information: the text at the bottom of the inscription was
generated using a Vigenere cipher and the ﬁrst two words of the plaintext are to be:
RAIDERS BEWARE —– — — ———– – —— — ——–
The cipher was generated using a 6-letter keyword which is still unknown. Furthermore, the
text symbols used for constructing the key for the cipher are only the 23 letters (A-W) shown
in Figure 1.
•Determine the key for the Vigenere cipher. Show your work. [ 5 points ]
•Recover the rest of the message using the key. [ 3 points ]
•How would you solve the cipher if the key length was not known? [ 2 points ]
3. Convert the following ASCII string to Base64: 3DES

3Problem 2 [30 points]
1. Consider the following block encryption structure. The input block is divided into 3 sub-
blocks: Lin(left sub-block), Min(middle sub-block), and Rin(right sub-block). The en-
crypted output block is composed of Lout,Mout, and Routas in the input block.
You can assume the key size is the same as the block size (the exact size is not important).
Design the decryption structure: [ 10 points ]
Show how the decryption works. Formulate the encryption and decryption equations. Use
these equations to show how Lin,Min, and Rincan be recovered from Lout,Mout, and Rout.
[10 points ]42. In the DES Feistel function, if the values in the S-boxes were all set to 0, the DES output
ciphertext would be equal to the input plaintext. Explain why this is the case. [ 5 points ]
3. What would happen in DES encryption if, in addition to all the S-boxes set to 0, all the
numbers in the P-box are set to zero? Your answer should explain what happens to the ﬁnal
ciphertext as well as what happens to the P-box output block (i.e. the immediate output
after applying the new P-box permutation). [ 5 points ]
5Problem 3 [23 points]
1. Let Cbe the set of all complex numbers such that x∈Cifx=a+b×i, where a, b∈Rand
i=√−1. We know that Cforms an abelian group under arithmetic addition. Complete the
following:
(a) Does the set of all complex numbers under arithmetic addition and multiplication
{C,+,×}form a ring, an integral domain or a ﬁeld? Explain in detail by showing
the properties that are satisﬁed. [ 3 points ]
(b) The set of real numbers, Rforms a subset under Cby setting b= 0, for all x=
a+b×i, x∈C. We know that Runder arithmetic addition and multiplication {R,+,×}
forms a ﬁeld.
Similarly, the set of imaginary numbers, Iis formed by setting a= 0 for all x=
a+b×i, x∈C. Is{I,+,×}also a ﬁeld? If not, what is it? Explain your answer by
showing the properties that are satisﬁed. [ 5 points ]
2. Suppose you are on the integer number line and you can only take steps of 79 or 19 either
to the left or right. How would you go from 0 to 1? (The diagram below is notto scale). [ 5
points ]
3. Ifa|bc(i.e.ais a divisor of bc) and gcd(a, b) = 1, prove that a|c. [ 5 points ]
4. Find ( n−1)! mod ngiven that n is a prime number. Explain how you got your answer. [ 5
points ]Problem 4 [16 points]
1. For the irreducible polynomial x3+x2+ 1 in GF(23), compute the following results for the
bitstrings B1= 110 , B2= 011. You can use whichever method you like to solve them (bitwise
operations or convert them to polynomials and solve).
(a)B1×B2 [3 points ]
(b)B1/B2 [4 points ]
2. The following problems are related to Euclid’s Algorithm
(a) Show that Euclid’s algorithm can be used to ﬁnd the GCD of three integers [ 4 points ]
(b) Given below is the Python implementation of the Euclid’s algorithm to ﬁnd the GCD
of two integers. Modify the code to ﬁnd the GCD of three integers: [ 2 points ]
1 #!/usr/bin/env python
2 ## GCD.py
3 import sys
4 if len(sys.argv) != 3:
5 sys.exit("\nUsage: %s <integer> <integer>\n" % sys.argv[0])

9 while b:
10 a,b = b, a%b
11
12 print("\nGCD: %d\n" % a)
(NOTE: You do not need to provide a working script - only present the implementation
logic with pseudocode.)
(c) You are given three positive integers a, b, c such that gcd(a, b, c ) = 1. Which of the
following statements is true for the integers pairs ( a, b), (a, c) and ( b, c)?
i. All three pairs are also relatively prime.
ii. At least one of the pairs is relatively prime.
iii. Information is not suﬃcient to answer.

7Problem 5 [11 points]
1. Below is a Python code snippet from an incorrect implementation of the row shifting step of
the AES algorithm. There is a bug in the code due to it being an incorrect implementation.
Find the bug in the code and correct it. [ 5 points ]
1def row_shifting(input_block):
2 # Form the state array as a list of bytes
3 byte_array = [input_block[byte_index * 8:(byte_index + 1)* 8]for byte_index
in range(16)]
4 shift_block = BitVector(size=0)
5 # Compute the new columns after row shifting
6 col_1 = byte_array[0] + byte_array[13] + byte_array[10] + byte_array[7]
7 col_2 = byte_array[4] + byte_array[1] + byte_array[14]] + byte_array[11]
8 col_3 = byte_array[8] + byte_array[5] + byte_array[2] + byte_array[15]
9 col_4 = byte_array[12] + byte_array[9] + byte_array[6] + byte_array[3]
10 # Construct the shifted block
11 shift_block += col_1 + col_2 + col_3 + col_4
12 return shift_block
2. Explain the vulnerability in using block ciphers (such as AES or DES) in electronic codebook
(ECB) mode. Then explain in general how the other modes of operation for block ciphers
avoid this (while these modes have their diﬀerences, the general mechanism by which they
avoid the vulnerability is the same). [ 6 points ]
