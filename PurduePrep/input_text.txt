This is a test! secret key: A secret key is used either to set some or all of the various parameters used by the encryption algorithm or for directly mixing with the plaintext. The important thing to note is that, in classical
 cryptography, the same secret key is used for encryption and
 decryption. It is for this reason that classical cryptography is also
 referred to as symmetric key cryptography. On the other hand,
 in the more recently developed cryptographic algorithms, the
 encryption and decryption keys are not only different, but also
 one of them is placed in the public domain. Such algorithms are
 commonly referred to as asymmetric key cryptography, public key
 cryptography, etc.
 deciphering or decryption: Recovering plaintext from ciphertext
 decryption algorithm: The sequence of data processing steps that go into
 transforming ciphertext back into plaintext. In classical cryptography,
 the various parameters used by a decryption algorithm are derived from
 the same secret key that was used in the encryption algorithm. In
 modern cryptography, the decryption algorithm mixes the secret key
 with the ciphertext but in a manner that is inverse of what was done by
 the encryption algorithm.
